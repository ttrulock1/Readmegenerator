NODE README GENERATOR

This is the Updated README GENERATOR (2.0) developed by Todd Trulock. Everything has been corrected and detailed below, while also describing features.

HOW THE README GENERATOR WORKS:

 When user is prompted for information about my application repository, a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions When user enters their project title, then this is displayed as the title of the README. When user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests. Whe user chooses a license for my application from a list of options, then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under, when I enter my GitHub username, then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile, when I enter my email address, then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions, when I click on the links in the Table of Contents, then I am taken to the corresponding section of the README
